- Reliable way to track performance changes given the input parameters
    - Save losses into a JSON X
    - Plot all losses at the end of the training X
    - Save a used model
    - Do we need val? 
    - Checkpointing? 
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Run tracking 
    - First we need to train a model that can actually detect something 
- Tracking evaluatution 
- Detection evalutation
